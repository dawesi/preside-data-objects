# Preside Data Objects Framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pixl8/preside-data-objects.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pixl8/preside-data-objects)

This is a repository for the data framework used by PresideCMS. We are currently in the process of separating this logic from the core of Preside itself so that we can use it elsewhere and focus on better architecture.

Nothing to see here, yet.
